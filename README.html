<p>Build a REST API to deal cards from a PokerDeck</p>
<p><em>Author: Bruno Martinez</em> <em>Date : 21/01/2018</em></p>
<p><em>Git: https://github.com/bmcmartinez/pokerdeck-rest<em><p>
<h2 id="subject">Subject</h2>
<p>Your assignment is to code, in an objected-oriented programming language, a set of classes and a REST API that represent a deck of poker-style playing cards. (Fifty-two playing cards in four suits: hearts, spades, clubs, diamonds, with face values of Ace, 2-10, Jack, Queen, and King.)</p>
<p>Within one of your classes, you must provide two operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>shuffle()</li>
</ul>
<p>Shuffle returns no value, but results in the cards in the deck being randomly permuted. Please do not use library-provided “shuffle” operations to implement this function. You may use library- provided random number generators in your solution.</p>
<ul>
<li>dealOneCard()</li>
</ul>
<p>This function should return one card from the deck to the caller. Specifically, a call to shuffle followed by 52 calls to dealOneCard should result in the caller being provided all 52 cards of the deck in a random order. If the caller then makes a 53rd call to dealOneCard, no card is dealt.</p>
<p>After implementing this internal interface, you must expose the functions to create a deck, shuffle a deck, and deal a card from a deck via a REST API. The structure of the REST API is up to you but please consider the combination of resources and actions represented by this problem and make appropriate tradeoffs in compliance to strict REST doctrine.</p>

<h2 id="implementation-details">Implementation details</h2>
<h3 id="poker-deck-model">Poker Deck model</h3>
<p>To shuffle the poker deck I wrote my own shuffle method base on the popular algorithm of Fisher And Yates, in a generic class. The random number generation uses the standard <code>java.util.Random</code>, which is enough for this project (<code>java.security.SecureRandom</code> may be preferred when security is involved or for implementing real gambling game)</p>
<h3 id="poker-deck-storage">Poker Deck storage</h3>
<p>Instead of storing the full deck (list of cards), I introduced the concept of DeckSnapshot that captures the current state of a Deck and allows to restore it later. DeckSnapshot actually contains a copy of the seed number used to initialize the random number generator in the last shuffling operation. Thus, shuffling a new Deck instance with same seed number will result in obtaining the same card sequence order as in the original Deck instance.</p>
<h3 id="java-rest-server">Java Rest Server</h3>
<p>I tried to used common libraries relying of standard concept of Java REST Servers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jersey library implementing the standard JAX-RS API (RESTful Web Services)</li>
<li>Hibernate library implementing the standard JPA API (Persistence API)</li>
<li>Additionally I used the popular jackson library for converting object to/from JSON format.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the actual HTTP server and Databases implementation and how to test it locally with Junit, I took examples from this website: https://technologyconversations.com/2014/03/26/application-development-back-end-solution-with-java/</p>
<p>It uses: * HSQLDB for the database (in memory flavor) * Grizzly Web Server</p>

<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>
<p>I wrote many unit tests using Junit and I reached a coverage of 85.5% on the main source directory (excluding test files). To gain time I did not unit tested method such as &quot;toString()&quot; (not critical in the project) or basic setters/getters.</p>
<p>I did manual testing with curl command line tool.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>This was extremely interesting do to this projects as it was the opportunity to have a refresh on the latest Java technology (these last years I rather developed in C++ and python). I took this opportunity to read many documentation and I learned a lot.</p>
